    Chicken Tinga Tacos
</h2>
<h4>
    What Is Tinga
</h4>
<p>
    During the colonial period, cooks in the state of Puebla, Mexico, invented the tingas, which are a true marriage between Spain and Mexico.

    Using a mixture of European and Mexican foods with a European cooking method, tinga became one of the most popular dishes in Mexico.

   </p>
   <p> Onions and garlic are sauteed. Tomatoes are added, then stock, herbs, and spices are put in. The mixture is simmered to make a sauce.

    The pre-cooked meat and sometimes chorizo sausage are added with canned chipotle chile. A tinga is really a stew, prepared in a special way. Chiles, onions, garlic, and tomatoes are NEVER ground and cooked in fat as they are in moles.

    Tinga can be made with all kinds of meat like chicken (pollo), beef (res), or pork (puerco) in a spicy, smoky sauce made with tomatoes, chiles, Chipotle in adobo, and lots of onions.
</p>

<h4> What Is a Chile Chipotle</h4>
<p>
    Chipotles are jalapeno chiles that are picked when fully ripe and red. They are left to dry on mats in the sun, then smoked. After that, the chiles are rehydrated and pickled in a rich adobo sauce made with vinegar and spices.
    The recipe below uses Chipotle peppers in Adobo, and you can buy them in any grocery store that carries Mexican products.
</p>

<h4> What is Adobo</h4>
<p>
    Adobo means in Spanish a pickle sauce, but it is used in Mexico to mean a very thick chile sauce which usually, but not always, contains a little vinegar. The Adobo itself varies from recipe to recipe.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken– the traditional Mexican recipe uses chicken breast, but thighs are great to use as well. For the ones out there who would like shortcuts, rotisserie chicken works beautifully. You need to shred it. </li>
<li>Onions– white onions are the typical onions used in Mexico in a lot of recipes.</li>
<li> Tomatoes– Use fire-roasted tomatoes in a can, crushed tomatoes, or even tomato sauce or paste.
</li>
<li> Chipotle chiles
</li>
<li> Garlic cloves
</li>
<li> Vegetable Oil or lard– both are very popular
</li>
<li> Salt, pepper
</li> <li>Oregano, thyme, marjoram
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Bring a pot of water and salt to a boil and add the chicken breast to cook. <br>
        <p>Allow the chicken breast to simmer until it is cooked through.
        This is a basic recipe, but you can add other things to the pot, an onion cut in quarters, some Mexican dried oregano, 1-2 garlic cloves. Make sure you skim the foam that forms on top of the water as it starts simmering.  </p>  </li>
    <li>
        Prepare the other ingredients. 
        <p>While the chicken is cooking, slice the onions. Heat up the oil in a large pan and add the onion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cook the onion until soft and translucent for about 5-6 minutes. The authentic Mexican chicken tinga has lots of onions that give sweetness and flavor to the dish, so if you do not love onions, this dish might not be for you.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
The Tomato sauce </li>
        <p>Place the tomatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with water, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and mushy but not falling apart.
            In a blender, place the tomatoes, garlic, salt, pepper and 2-3 chiles chipotle from the can.
            After blending the ingredients, taste the salsa for salt and pepper and adjust the seasoning if you need to. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Tip: If you do not have fresh tomatoes, use diced tomatoes or tomato sauce in a can instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE:Be careful with the chiles. The original Mexican recipe calls for the entire can of Chipotle, but I found it to be too powerful and spicy for us, so I added fewer chiles in the blender.
        </p>
<LI>Shred the chicken and mix it with the sauce.
    </li><BR>
    <li>
Bringing the sauce together</li>
<p>
    Mix the salsa with the onions. Add oregano, marjoram, thyme.

Mexican oregano is the traditional spice, so feel free to add or skip the marjoram and the thyme entirely if you don’t like them. Let it simmer on low heat while you take the chicken out of the water. Be careful as the sauce will steam and bubble.

Stir occasionally, partially covered, until the sauce becomes darker and thicker.
